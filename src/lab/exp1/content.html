        <h3>1. The Linux File System</h3>
        <p align="justify">The file system is a method of consistently
        naming objects and organizing them in an orderly manner. Some
        of the operating system like windows organize the file system
        in drives.  The Linux file system is a directory tree that is
        consistent with each Linux distribution.  This directory tree
        begins with the "/" (root) and then expands under that
        position like an upside down tree. Each directory under "/"
        has a specific purpose whether it is to store system files,
        constantly changing log files, device drivers or files created
        by users on the system.</p>

        <p align="justify"> A home directory is a file system
        sub-directory on a multi-user operating system containing
        files for a given user of the system.  A user's home directory
        is intended to contain that user's files; including text
        documents, music, pictures or videos, etc. /home/aditi
        refers to the home directory of the user aditi, ~ is
        equivalent to the /home/aditi which is the current users
        home directory.  </p>

	<p align="justify"> The file system also contains a method of
        securing files, directories and objects in the file
        system. This is represented by the file permissions that are
        explained in the experiment<a href="../exp4/index.html"> File
        Permissions</a> </p>

        <h3>2. The Command Line Prompt</h3>
	<p align="justify"> The commands that will be described are
         meant to be executed from a command line interface.  The
         command line prompt that shows up in the terminal window
         contains useful information.  It has the form:</p>
        <pre class='code'>aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$</pre>
        <p align="justify"> There are three parts in the command line
        prompt, separated by @ : and $ </p>
	<p align="justify">The first part before the '@' shows the
	  user who is logged in at that moment. In the above example it
	  is the user aditi. The second part between the @ and the :
	  shows the name of the computer that you are working on. In
	  the above example it is mylaptop. The third part, between
	  the : and the $ shows the current directory that you are
	  working on. In the above example it is ~/Documents (~ is a
	  shortcut for the user’s home directory; ~/Documents is
	  equivalent to /home/aditi/Documents). When you change
	  the current directory, then they can find the third part of
	  the command line prompt changing.</p>


	<h3>3. Viewing the contents of files and directories </h3>
	<p align="justify">Viewing the contents of files and
	directories using three commands, namely <b>pwd</b>, <b>ls</b>
	and <b>cat</b>.</p>
        <p><font size="3"><b>a. pwd command</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify">At any time, in order to see the current directory you can
        type <b>pwd</b>(<b>P</b>resent <b>W</b>orking <b>D</b>irectory).</p>
	<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ pwd
 /home/aditi/Documents</pre>

	<p> <font size="3"><b>b. ls command</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify">To list the contents of a directory,
	the <b>ls</b> command is used. When it is executed with no
	arguments, it lists the contents of the current working
	directory.</p>
        
	<p align="justify">The path of a file is the location of a file in the
	filesystem. There are two ways of specifying the path of a
	file: <i>relative path</i> and <i>absolute
	path</i>. <i>Relative path</i> is the location of a file
	relative to your current location in the filesystem.
	<i>Absolute path</i> is the location of the file with respect to
	the root directory. It is independent of the current working
	directory.</p>

        
	      <img src="./media/directory-path-example.png" width="400px"/><br/>
	    <p align="justify">  <span style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Figure
		1 </span> </p>
	    
        <p align="justify"> Example1 : Consider the above directory
        tree (Figure 1)from which we want to list the contents of the
        folder my_project. Consider our present working directory is
        /home/aditi/Documents. Doing "ls my_project" would list the
        contents of folder my_project, we are using the relative path
        here as we are listing from the current working directory. If
        we use "ls /home/aditi/Documents/my_project" from the current
        working directory, this is considered as the absolute path as
        we are specifying from "/".</p>
        

        <pre class='code'>aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls my_project
vlabs_ui</pre>
	<p align="justify">In the above example, the <i>relative
	path</i> of the directory has been used.</p>

	<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls /home/aditi/Documents/my_project
 vlabs_ui</pre>
	<p align="justify">In the above example, the <i>absolute
	path</i> of the directory has been used. As we can see, the
	two paths are equivalent.</p>

	<p align="justify"> Referring to the above Figure:1  and assuming
	 our present working directory is /home/aditi/Documents. "."
	 refers to the current directory i.e. Documents and ".."
	 refers to the parent directory(of the current directory) in
	 our example it is aditi(home directory).</p>
	<p> "ls ."  will display all the contents
	 of the current directory</p>
        <pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls .
all_about_console.txt  example.txt  my_project</pre>
	<p align="justify"> "ls .." will display all
	the contents of the parent directory</p> 
        <pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls ..
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures</pre>

	<p> The most used options for the <b>ls</b> command are l,
	a. </p>

<p align="justify">Whenever you need help about commands in Linux, you
can read the man pages, which contain detailed information about
commands and their options. To know more about the ls command, see the
man page, type:
<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ man ls</pre>
<p align="justify">Information about the command will appear on the
screen. You can move up and down using the arrow keys. In order to
exit from the man page type key "q".</p>
        <p><font size="3"><b>c. cat command</b></font></p>
	<p><b>cat</b> command displays the contents of the file passed as
	argument. If multiple files are passed, it prints the
	concatenated content of all the files.</p>
       <pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ cat virtual-lab.txt
Welcome to Linux Lab!</pre> 
       <p>In the above example cat displays content of the file
       virtual-lab.txt.</p>

       <p>Type the <b>clear</b> command to clear your screen.</p>

       <h3>4. Moving through directories:</h3>

	<p><font size="3"><b>a. cd command</b></font></p>
        <p>The command <b>cd</b> (<b>c</b>hange <b>d</b>irectory)
	  allows us to move through directory trees. It has one
	  parameter: target directory path. If no parameter is
	  mentioned it will go to the current users home
	  directory.  If the parameter ".." is used, it will take you
	  to previous directory(parent directory).</p>
<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ cd my_project
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents/my_project$ pwd
/home/aditi/Documents/my_project

aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents/my_project$ cd ..
/home/aditi/Documents

aditi@mylaptop:~Documents/my_project$ cd 

aditi@mylaptop:~$ pwd
/home/aditi</pre>

	<h3>5. Creating files and folders:</h3>

	<p><font size="3"><b>b. touch command</b></font></p>
	<p>It creates an empty file directly from the command line. In
	  order to do it, type:</p>
	<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls
all_about_console.txt example.txt my_project
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ touch newfile.txt
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls 
all_about_console.txt  example.txt my_project newfile.txt</pre>
	<p>An empty file with the specified name will be created.  If
	  a file with that name already exists on disk, it will remain
	  there and moment of last update is changed in the properties
	  of the file.</p>

	<p><font size="3"><b>c. mkdir command</b></font></p>
        <p>The <b>mkdir</b> command takes one or more parameters and
        creates the folders corresponding to the parameters.
	</p>
<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls 
all_about_console.txt  example.txt  my_project newfile.txt 
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ mkdir new_folder
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls 
all_about_console.txt  example.txt  my_project newfile.txt new_folder</pre>

	<h3>6. Copying, Moving and removing files and folders:</h3>

	<p><font size="3"><b>a. cp command</b></font></p>
        <p><b>cp</b> command is used to create a copy of files. It can
	  be invoked with two arguments, <i>SOURCE</i> and <i>DEST</i>
	  in which case it copies <i>SOURCE</i> to <i>DEST</i>.</p>
<pre class="code"> aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls
all_about_console.txt  example.txt  my_project new_folder

aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ cd my_project
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls
vlabs_ui 

aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ cp example.txt my_project/example_copy.txt
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls my_project
vlabs_ui  example_copy.txt</pre>
              
       <p>For copying directories, the <b>-r</b> (recursive) option is
       used.</p>
<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~Documents$ ls my_project
vlabs_ui example_copy.txt
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ cp -r new_folder my_project/new_folder_copy 
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ cd my_project
aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls
vlabs_ui example_copy.txt new_folder_copy</pre>
       <p><font size="3"><b>b. mv command</b></font></p>
       <p>The <b>mv</b> command is used to change the location of
       directories and files or renaming them. Parameters are taken in
       a similar way as the <b>cp</b> command.</p>
<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls
vlabs_ui example_copy.txt new_folder_copy
 
 aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ mv example.txt my_project/example_move.txt

 aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls my_project
 vlabs_ui  example_copy.txt new_folder_copy example_move.txt </pre>

      <p><font size="3"><b>c. rm command</b></font></p>
      <p><b>rm</b> command removes files. It can be used with
      the <b>-r</b> option to remove directories.</p>
<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls 
all_about_console.txt  example.txt  my_project  newfile.txt  new_folder 

aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ rm example.txt

aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ rm -r new_folder

aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ ls
all_about_console.txt  my_project  newfile.txt</pre>

     <p><font size="3"><b>d. rmdir command</b></font></p>
     <p><b>rmdir</b> command removes empty directories.</p>
<pre class="code">aditi@mylaptop:~/Documents$ mkdir new_folder
