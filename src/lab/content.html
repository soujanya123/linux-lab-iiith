	    Welcome to the Linux Lab!  This lab provides
	    an introduction to Linux. The lab consists of performing
	    basic system operations such as file management, text
	    editing, permission management, etc.  Various commands for
	    compressing files or for obtaining system information are
	    explained as part of this lab.  Common tools and techniques
	    used for searching and working with file permissions are
	    also covered.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The objective of this lab is to make students
	    familiar with the Linux command-line environment.
	    This lab also promotes basic understanding of
	    system administration processes by providing a
	    hands-on experience.  It is expected that by
	    using this lab the students will become
	    comfortable in working with a Linux machine.

	  Using the Lab

	<div id="lab-article-section-7-content" class="content">
	  <p align="justify">
	    This lab consists of nine experiments.  Each experiment is
	    further divided into theory, tasks and quiz sections.  The
	    theory section provides detailed information about the
	    commands related to the experiment.  Users are expected to
	    try these commands while reading the theory. A web based
	    shell has been provided for convenient access to a Linux
	    shell.  Once the student has read and understood the theory,
	    he /she should perform the experiments. </p>

	  <p>
	    Once tasks mentioned in the tasks section have been
	    performed, questions mentioned in the quiz section can be
	    attempted.  This will help the student in judging his/her
	    understanding of various concepts covered as part of the
	    experiment.  Students are also encouraged to go through the
	    further reading section to learn more about the experiment
	    and its commands.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    To use the shell access provided with the
	    experiment, following steps are required:
   	    <ol>
	      <li>
		Students should register by
		clicking <a href="php/register-form.php">here</a>
		and obtain a virtual-labs user ID and
		password.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		The web interface for shell can be
		accessed <a href="http://gateone.cse09.virtual-labs.ac.in">here</a>.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Login into shell using the following values:
		<pre class="code">
		  Host / IP or SSH URL : ssh.cse09.virtual-labs.ac.in
		  Port : 22
		  Username : &lt;Virtual-labs user ID&gt;
		  Password : &lt;Virtual-labs password&gt;
		</pre>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </p>

	  <p style="font-style:italic">
	    Note that the shell access requires you to have direct
	    access without any proxy server to Internet.  This restriction
	    is due to limited support for "Web Sockets" from many proxy
	    servers.
