	      <h3>grep Command</h3>

	      <p align="justify">

		<code>grep</code> is an extremely powerful search
		utility.  <code>grep</code> searches the specified file
		for the lines matching the input pattern given as an argument
		to the command.  By default, for each line that matches
		or contains a match to the input pattern, it prints that
		line as an output.

		<br />
		<br />

		The syntax for using grep command is:
		<br />
		<code>grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]</code>
		<br />
		where OPTIONS are the various options available with the grep command,
		PATTERN is the input pattern to search for, FILE is the
		file containing the text which is matched against the pattern. 

		<br /> 
		<br />

		<b>The input pattern should always be enclosed within
		single-quotes.  Input pattern can also be mentioned as a
		regular expression.</b>

		<br /> 
		<br />

		<b>Regular Expressions</b>
		<br />

		Regular expressions are used to specify a sequence of
		characters given as input.  To explain the usage
		of <code>grep</code> command with regular expressions, a
		test file <i>example.txt</i> has been created as shown
		below.

		<pre class="code">
$ cat example.txt
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

	      <p align="justify">

		The rules for constructing regular expressions have been explained below. 

		<br />
		<br />

		1. Any character is a pattern that matches itself. Thus,
		each of the character is a regular expression in itself.

		    <pre class="code">
$ grep 'a' example.txt
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23</pre>

		    </p>

		<p align="justify">

		    The command matches 'a' in every line of the
		    file.  <b>Please note that when the command is
		    executed in the shell, the pattern given in the
		    command is highlighted in the output.</b>  Thus, in
		    the above example, every occurrence of 'a' is
		    highlighted in red color in the shell.

		    <br />
		    <br />

		    This rule doesn't apply to some special characters like
		    '*','.' etc.  To match
		    these special characters, backslash ('\') should
		    precede them to escape the characters.

		    <br />
		    <br />

		    2. Concatenation: Concatenation is achieved by writing
		    regular expression in sequence. For example, regular
		    expressions 'a' and 'b' can be concatenated to form
		    a single regular expression 'ab'.

		    <br />
		    <br />

		    White space characters like space are also treated as regular
		    expressions.  The strings 'ab' and 'a b' are two different regular
		    expressions.

		    <pre class="code">
$ grep 'ab' example.txt 
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23

$ grep 'a b' example.txt
$</pre>

		    </p>

		<p align="justify">

		  All the lines with the pattern 'ab' are printed.  But, for the second
		  command, there is no output because there is not pattern 'a b' in the
		  file.

		    <br />
		    <br />

		  3. Brackets ([]): A list of characters enclosed within
		  '[' and ']' matches any single character in that list.

		    <pre class="code">
$ grep '[abcd]' example.txt
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  4. The meta character '-' is used to specify the range
		  of characters for pattern matching.  For example, if a
		  string might include any alphabet, regular expression
		  to match the pattern is written as [a-z]. 

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '[0-9]' example.txt
123456
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The first command matches the lines with numeric
		  digits in it.  

		  <br />
		  <br />

		  5. The meta characters '^' and '$' are used to match the
		  beginning and end strings or patterns.

		  <br />
		  ^ - matches the characters or string at the beginning of the line
		  <br />
		  $ - matches the characters or string at the end of the line

		      <pre class="code">
$ grep '^ab' example.txt
abcdefgh
abababab
ab*23

$ grep 'ab$' example.txt
abababab</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The first command in the above example outputs the lines which start
		  with 'ab'.  The second command outputs the lines which end with 'ab'
		  string.  

		  <br />
		  <br />

		  6. Dot Character: The '.' meta character is used to
		  match any single character.  For example, the
		  following command matches any pattern which start with
		  'a' and ends with '3' and has any three characters in
		  between.

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep 'a...3' example.txt
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  7. Repititions: The following operators repeat the occurrence of any
		  character to which they are applied. 

		  <br />
		  * - matches preceding pattern zero or more times
		  <br />
		  ? - matches preceding pattern at most one time
		  <br />
		  + - matches preceding pattern at least once
		  <br />
		  {n} - matches preceding pattern exactly n times
		  <br />
		  {n,} - matches preceding pattern n or more times
		  <br />
		  {n,m} - matches preceding pattern at least n and at most m times

		  <br />
		  <br />

		  <b>Note: Except '*', all the operators have to be
		  preceded with backslash ('\').</b>

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep 'a*' example.txt
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command outputs all the strings which start with a zero or more times. 

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '^ab*' example.txt
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command outputs all the strings which start with 'a' and is followed by 'b'
		  zero or more times.

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '^\(ab\)\(ab\)*' example.txt
abcdefgh
abababab
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command searches for all the patterns in the text file which start with 'ab'
		  and may or not have any more 'ab' pattern. 

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '^ab\?' example.txt
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command searches for all the patterns which start with 'a' and followed by
		  zero or one 'b'.

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '^ab\+' example.txt
abcdefgh
abababab
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command searches for all the patterns which start with 'a' and followed by
		  at least one 'b'.

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '.\{10\}' example.txt
ABCDefgh1234</pre>
		
		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command searches for a string exactly 10 characters long.

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '.\{6,\}' example.txt
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command searches for a string at least 6 characters long.

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '.\{6,10\}' example.txt
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  The above command searches for a string at least 6 characters long and at most 10
		  characters long.

		    <br />
		    <br />

		    8. Parentheses '()' can be used to denote a regular expressions. 'abcd' is
		    concatenation of four regular expressions 'a', 'b', 'c'and 'd', but
		    '(ab)cd' is a concatenation of three regular expressions 'ab', 'c' and
		    'd'.

		    <br />
		    <br />

		    Note: Parentheses are treated as part of the string
		    unless they are escaped with backslash('\').

		    <pre class="code">
$ grep '\(ab\)cd' example.txt
$ grep '\(ab\)*cd' example.txt
abcdef gefrd geef
(ab)cd
abghefcd
aaaaaaacd
bbbbbbbcdfeg
ababababcdefgh
abcdefgh
abcdefgh</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">

		  Since, there is no 'ab' string enclosed within
		  brackets, the first command does not give any output.
		  But, the second command matches the string pattern
		  given because of the use of backslash before the
		  parentheses.

		  <br />
		  <br />

		  <b>Options</b>

		  <br />
		  <br />

		  Grep can be used with the following options:

		  <br />

		  <b>v</b> - it reverses the pattern specified and prints all
		  the lines that DO NOT match the specified regular expression

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep '\(1234\)' example.txt
123456
ABCDefgh1234

$ grep -v '\(1234\)' example.txt
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">
		  
		  Compare the above commands and note the difference. 

		  <br />
		  <br />

		  <b>A (num)</b> - <code>grep</code> takes a numeric
		  value <i>num</i> as an argument and prints <i>num</i>
		  lines of the file text after the pattern match

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep -A 2 'ab*' example.txt
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">
		  
		  In the above output, the command prints two lines
		  after every pattern match.

		  <br />
		  <br />

		  <b>B (num)</b> - as opposed to the A option, this option
		  prints <i>num</i> lines of text in the file BEFORE the
		  pattern match

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep -B 2 'ab*' example.txt
123456
abcdefgh
aabbaabb
abababab
ABCDefgh1234
ab*23</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">
		  
		  <b>c</b> - it prints the number of lines matching the pattern
		  specified

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep -c 'ab*' example.txt
4</pre>

		</p>

		<p align="justify">
		  
		  <b>o</b> - the option prints only the matched patterns

		  <pre class="code">
$ grep -o 'ab*' example.txt
ab
a
abb
a
abb
ab
ab
ab
ab
ab</pre>

		</p>

	      	<h3>find Command</h3>

		<p align="justify">

		The <i>find</i> command is used to locate files on Linux system.  The
		command searches for the set of directory specified in the argument for
		the files.  The syntax for <code>find</code> is:

		<br/>

		<code>find [path] [option] [file name / expression]</code>

		<br />

		where path is the directory where the file is to be located, file name
		is the file to be located and expression are the regular expressions
		which can be used for pattern matching.

		<br />
		<br />

		Executing <code>find</code> in the terminal lists down all the files in
		the current directory.  The command recursively searches all the files
		and folders in the directory.

		<pre class="code">
$ ls
abcd.org test/

$ find
.
./test
./test/dir
./test/dir/abc.org
./test/image2.jpg
./test/image1.jpg
./test/abc.tar
./test/abc.zip
./test/abd
./test/abc.org
./abcd.org</pre>

		</p>

	      <p align="justify">

		<code>find</code> command provides many options for use.  In this
		tutorial, only two commonly used options would be explained.  For
		further information, please refer to the man page of <code>find</code>.
		<br /> 
		<b>iname</b> - takes an argument and recursively searches the specified
		directory for the given file name or pattern 
		<br /> 
		<b>delete</b> - sometimes, the files no longer needed have to be deleted.
		So, <code>find</code> command is used to locate them and delete is used
		to delete the files

		<pre class="code">
$ find -iname abc.org
./test/dir/abc.org
./test/abc.org</pre>

		</p>

	      <p align="justify">

		To find the files in a specified directory,

		<pre class="code">
$ find test/ -iname abc.org
test/test/dir/abc.org
test/test/abc.org</pre>

		</p>

	      <p align="justify">

		To search for a file using a regular expression pattern, 

		<pre class="code">
$ find test/ -iname 'ab*'
test/test/dir/abc.org
test/test/abc.tar
test/test/abc.zip
test/test/abd
test/test/abc.org
test/abcd.org</pre>

		</p>

	      <p align="justify">

		To delete the specified file,

		<pre class="code">
$ find test/ -iname abc.org -delete</pre>

	      </p>

	      <p align="justify">

		Please note that the delete Option should be used with caution.  It
		should always be at the end of the command arguments.  If the delete
		option is used before iname, all the files and folders would be deleted.
		The command does not ask for permission or provide any warning,
		whatsoever, before execution.  

		</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>

	      <p align="justify">

		The <code>grep</code> and <code>find</code> commands have been explained
		in the theory section.  Now, the user should be able use these commands
		to locate files in the directories easily.  For further information on
		the commands, please refer to the Further Readings Section.
