		In order to understand the output of the commands used
		in this experiment, you should know the terminologies
		used. Some of them are given below.</p><br/>
	      <p><b>Process:</b><br/> 
		A process is a running instance of a program.
		Sometimes it can be referred to as a task.
		<br/>
		A <b>program</b> is a set of instructions that are
		meant to perform a specific task.</p><br/>
	      <p><b>Memory units:</b><br/>
		1 Kilo Byte (KB) = 1024 Bytes<br/>
		1 Mega Byte (MB) = 1024 Kilo Bytes <br/>
		1 Giga Byte (GB) = 1024 Mega Bytes <br/>
		1 Tera Byte (TB) = 1024 Giga Bytes <br/>
	      </p>
	      <br/>
	      <p>
		The following are the list of Linux commands which are
		used to get the system information. The commands are
		divided according to their area of usage.
	      </p>
	      <br/>
	      <u><h2>Main Memory Usage</h2></u>
	      <h3>1. free:</h3> 
	      <p>
		The 'free' command prints the amount of total, free
		and used RAM (and swap) memory in the system, as well
		as the buffers used by the kernel.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
aditi@mylaptop:~$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1918584    1549980     368604          0     180488     704172
-/+ buffers/cache:     665320    1253264
Swap:      9577468          0    9577468	      </pre>
	      <p>
		"-h" option is used to get the numbers in human
		readable format, scaled to shortest three digit unit
		and display the units of print out. The units are
		mentioned above.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
aditi@mylaptop:~$ free -h
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          1.8G       1.5G       361M         0B       176M       687M
-/+ buffers/cache:       648M       1.2G
Swap:         9.1G         0B       9.1G</pre>	
	      
	      <ul>
		<li>The "total" column of "Mem:" row indicates the
		  memory size of the RAM. Here, in the above output,
		  you can see that the RAM is of 1.8GB, of which 1.5GB
		  is currently in use and 361MB is free.</li>
		<li>Since the memory used for buffers and cache can
		  easily be reclaimed for use by applications, the
		  second row (-/+ buffers/cache) provides an
		  indication of the memory actually used by
		  applications (the "used" column) or available to
		  applications (the "free" column). Here you can see
		  that the actual RAM used by the applications is
		  648MB and the available RAM is 1.2GB. That means,
		  the actual load is of 648MB only.</li>
		<li>The other options can be <b>ignored</b> for
		  now. Run manual <b>(man free)</b> to see more
		  information about "free" command.</li>
	      </ul>
	      
              <br/><br/>
	      <u><h2>Process related commands</h2></u>
	      <h3>1. ps</h3>
	      <p>The ps (process status) command is used to provide
		information about the currently running processes,
		including their process identification numbers (PIDs).
		Every process is assigned a unique PID by the system.
	      </p>
	      <pre class="code">
aditi@mylaptop:~$ ps
 PID TTY          TIME CMD
5957 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
6147 pts/2    00:00:00 ps</pre>
	      
	      <p>
		When <b>ps</b> is used without any option, it gives
		an output of running processes in the current shell,
		with four items of information. At least two processes
		will be displayed because those must be currently
		running on that shell: the shell and ps.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		A common and convenient way of using <b>ps</b> to
		obtain much more complete information about the
		processes currently on the system is to use the "aux"
		option, where:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li><h4>a</h4>option is to list the processes of
		  all users on the system rather than just those of
		  the current user with the exception of processes
		  not associated with a terminal.</li>
		<li><h4>u</h4> option tells ps to provide detailed
		  information about each process. This option
		  doesn't give the processes which do not have a
		  controlling terminal/shell.</li>
		<li><h4>x</h4> option adds to the list processes
		  that have no controlling terminal, such as
		  daemons, which are programs that are launched
		  during booting.</li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      <pre class="code">

	      <p>
		As the list of processes can be quite long and occupy
		more than a single screen, the output of "ps aux" cant
		be seen in a single screen. You need to <b>scroll
		up</b> to see the complete list.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p> The output gives more columns when "aux" is
		used. Some of the output columns are explained
		below. The remaining can be <b>ignored</b> for now.</p>
	      <ul>
		<li><h4>USER</h4>User who is owning/running the
		  process</li>
		<li><h4>%CPU</h4>It is the CPU time used divided by
		  the time the process has been running. It means,
		  the percentage of CPU resource it is using.</li>
		<li><h4>%MEM</h4>Percentage of RAM memory it is
		  using.</li>
		<li><h4>START</h4>starting time or date of the
		  process</li>
		<li><h4>TIME</h4>cumulative CPU time the process is
		  using.</li>
		<li><h4>COMMAND</h4>command with all its
		  arguments. </li>
	      </ul>
    
              <br/><br/>
              <h3>2. top</h3>
              <p>
		The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a
		running system.  It can display system summary
		information as well as a list of processes or threads
		currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
	      </p>
              <p>
		The program provides you an interactive interface for
		process manipulation as well as for personal
		configuration.

		<li>The above output is for one logical processor. As
		  it has 4 siblings, the same output will be repeated
		  for 3 more logical processors. Each logical
		  processor is identified with a unique id in the
		  first line (processor) itself.</li>
		<li>As the output shows, it has 2 CPU cores. That
		  means, its a dual core processor and each core
		  processor has one sibling, total of 4 siblings.</li>
		<li>It also shows that who is the vendor of the
		  processor, what is the model name and the capacity
		  of processor (in GHz). </li>
		<li>If you want to know whether the processor is of
		  32bit or 64bit, you have to check the flags. If "lm"
		  flag is present in the above output of <b>"more
		  /proc/cpuinfo"</b> (end of 3rd line of flags), then
		  the processor is of 64bit. If not, its a 32bit

	      <h3>1. df</h3>

	      <p>If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk
		device node containing a mounted file
		system, <b>df</b> shows the space available on that
		file system rather than on the file system containing
		the device node (which is always the root file
		system). </p>
	      
	      <p>-h option is used to print sizes in human readable

              <u><h2>Miscellaneous</h2></u>
	      <h3>1. date</h3>
	      <p>
		<b>date</b> command displays the current time in the
		given FORMAT, or set the system date.</p>
	      <p>
		If no argument is given, <b>date</b> command prints
		the current date and time.</p>
	      <pre class="code">
aditi@mylaptop:~$ date
Sat Dec 29 17:04:07 IST 2012</pre>

	      <p>Look for manual page of date command <b> (man
		  date)</b>to see the FORMAT strings. Setting the date
		  and time using <b>date</b> is out of the scope of
		  this tutorial.</p>
	      
              <h3>2. cal</h3>
              <p>The <b>cal</b> command displays a simple
		calendar. When <b>cal</b> command is invoked without
		any arguments, the calendar of the current month is
		displayed, highlighting the current day.</p>

              <ul>
		<li><h4>-m month</h4>Displays the specified
		  month.</li>
		<li><h4>-y year</h4>Displays a calendar for the
		  specified year. This option is implied when a year
		  but no month are specified on the command line.</li>
		<li><h4>-3</h4>Displays the previous, current and
		  next month surrounding today.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>Look for the manual page of cal command <b>(man
		  cal)</b> for more options.
	      </p>

	      <h3>3. uptime</h3>
	      <p><b>uptime</b> gives a one-line display of the
		information, viz., the current time, how long the
		system has been running, how many users are currently
		logged in, and the system load averages for the past
		1, 5, and 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>This is the same information contained in the header
